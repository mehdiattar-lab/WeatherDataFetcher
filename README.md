## WeatherDataFetcher (FMI â†’ MQTT)

Fetches **current observations** (temperature & solar irradiance) and **36-hour forecasts** from the **Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and publish them ** to **MQTT** as JSON.

- Observations: publish every **minute**
- Forecasts: publish every **hour** (36 hourly values)

## Quick start (Docker Compose)

This repo includes ready-to-use Compose files. Just clone, build, and run.

git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPO_DIR>

## build the fetcher image

docker build -t weather-data-fetcher:latest .

## bring up the stack (broker + fetcher + printer)

docker compose up -d

## see only the JSON payloads from the printer container

docker logs -f mqtt-printer

# Use only the weather-data-fetcher image

You can run the image standalone against any MQTT broker as well. The MQTT-Printer.py and Broker.py have been developed only for the sake of WeatherDataFetcher.py testing.
